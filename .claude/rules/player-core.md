## lp-player (the "utopia player")

`lp-player` is the Rust crate (binary + lib, edition 2024) that will replace mpvpaper +
`lp-transition` + per-monitor LWE + `lp-audio` with one process that owns every wallpaper
type, on every monitor, with every transition. Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-20-utopia-player-design.md`.
This file covers only what exists in the crate so far; later tasks append their own
sections below as they add modules (units, clock, graph, gfx, mpv, sources, recipes, api,
wl, headless, audio, probe, supervise, runtime — see the design's §file map).

**The core invariant (everything else follows from this):** never hand an audible or
visible stream from one owner to another — only ramp gains/opacities on streams that keep
running. A stream that will be heard starts silent and ramps up; a stream is only
destroyed after being ramped to silence. If this holds, dropouts and visual seams can't
happen regardless of timing.

## Module map

- `src/main.rs` — CLI entry point. Only `--version` is real (prints `lp-player <version>`
  from `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`); every other invocation, including no args, is a stub that
  prints `"not implemented yet"` to stderr and exits 2. Later tasks replace the stub
  branch with `serve`/`ctl`.
- `src/lib.rs` — module wiring only (`pub mod log;` for now). Add new `pub mod` lines here
  as later tasks add files; don't put logic in this file.
- `src/log.rs` — the event log (below).

**No `build.rs` yet.** The design's file map pairs `Cargo.toml`/`build.rs` together
(bindgen over `mpv/client.h` + `mpv/render_gl.h`), but that belongs with Task 10 (libmpv
wrapper), not this scaffold — don't add bindgen before there's an FFI surface to generate.
The flake's `lp-player` derivation already carries `rustPlatform.bindgenHook` +
`pkg-config` in `nativeBuildInputs` so adding `build.rs` later needs no flake change.

## Event log

JSON Lines, one object per event, schema:

```json
{"t_mono_ms": 123.4, "t_wall": "2026-10-20T12:00:00.000Z", "comp": "mpv", "level": "info", "kind": "source.load", "corr": "tr-12", "...fields": "merged at top level"}
```

- `t_mono_ms` — `f64` milliseconds since process start, from `Instant` (a true monotonic
  clock, never wall time) — monotonic across every event in a process, even across
  rotation.
- `t_wall` — RFC3339 wall time (`time::OffsetDateTime::now_utc()` +
  `format_description::well_known::Rfc3339`).
- `comp` — the emitting component (`&'static str`, e.g. `"mpv"`, `"graph"`).
- `level` — `Level` (`Error|Warn|Info|Debug|Trace`), serialized **lowercase**
  (`"error"`…`"trace"`). Declaration order is severity order: `Error` is most severe,
  `Trace` least — `Level` derives `Ord` from that, and both the logger's own threshold
  (set in `init`) and `LogFilter::min_level` compare against it directly (`event_level <=
  threshold` → keep).
- `kind` — a dotted event name (e.g. `"source.load"`, `"transition.start"`).
Freeform below `kind` by convention, not enforced.
- `corr` — `CorrId` (newtype `String`, serializes as a bare JSON string) or `null`. One
  correlation id ties together every event of one operation (a transition, a source load,
  a worker restart). Mint one with `log::new_corr(prefix)` → `"<prefix>-<n>"` (e.g.
  `new_corr("tr")` → `"tr-12"`); the counter is global across all prefixes, not per-prefix.
- `fields` (the `serde_json::Value` passed to `event`/`log::event`) — **must** serialize to
  a JSON object; its keys are merged at the top level alongside the fixed keys above. A
  field that collides with a fixed key (`comp`, `level`, …) silently overwrites it — pick
  field names that don't.

**Call it via the global, not `Logger` directly.** `log::init(dir, level)` sets up the
process-global logger (creates/appends `events.jsonl` in `dir`); `log::event(...)` and
`log::recent(...)` read/write it. `init` may only succeed once per process — a second call
returns `Err` (`io::ErrorKind::AlreadyExists`), never panics, so a second subsystem racing
to initialize logging can't take the process down. `event`/`recent` are no-ops (silently
drop / return `vec![]`) before `init` has run, so early callers don't need to guard every
call site. All of this is behind one `Mutex`, safe to call from any thread (the render loop
and the socket server both will).

**Rotation.** `events.jsonl` rotates when the *next* line would push it past
`DEFAULT_ROTATE_BYTES` (20 MiB = `20 * 1024 * 1024`, checked anticipatorily — the
check happens before the write, not after): `events.jsonl` → `events.1.jsonl` →
`events.2.jsonl` (oldest dropped), so at most 3 files ever exist. The threshold is
injectable (`Logger::init_with_limit`, crate-private) purely so tests can rotate in
milliseconds instead of writing a real 20 MiB — production code only ever goes through
`log::init`, which always uses `DEFAULT_ROTATE_BYTES`.

**`recent(filter, limit)`** — the in-memory side of the log: the last 10 000 events (a
ring buffer, oldest dropped first) filtered by `LogFilter { comp, corr, min_level,
kind_prefix }` (every `Some`/non-default field must match; `kind_prefix` is a
`str::starts_with` match on `kind`), returning up to `limit` matches **oldest-first**
within the most recent window — i.e. if more than `limit` events match, you get the
*newest* `limit` of them, but still in chronological order. This ring is independent of
what has or hasn't been rotated to disk — it survives rotation (rotation only touches the
files) and does not survive a process restart (nothing on disk is structured for random
access; re-reading history from `events*.jsonl` is a future task's problem, not `recent`'s).

**Gotcha:** `init`/`event`/`recent`/`new_corr` are the only public API — `Logger` and
`Logger::init_with_limit` are `pub(crate)`, used only by `log.rs`'s own tests so each test
gets an independent instance instead of fighting over the one process-global `OnceLock`.
Don't reach for `Logger` from outside `log.rs`; if you need a log in a test elsewhere in
the crate, that's a sign `log::init` should be called once from that test binary's setup,
not that `Logger` should become more public.
